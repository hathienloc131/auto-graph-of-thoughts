Sort this list using merge sort algorithm [5,6,1,5,6,3,9,1,2,0,1,2,9,4,7,8]
split
<Instruction>1. Split the list into two equal sub-lists: [5,6,1,5,6,3,9,1] and [2,0,1,2,9,4,7,8]
2. Split the first sub-list into two equal sub-lists: [5,6,1,5] and [6,3,9,1]
3. Split the second sub-list into two equal sub-lists: [2,0,1,2] and [9,4,7,8]
4. Split the third sub-list into two equal sub-lists: [5,6] and [1,5]
5. Split the fourth sub-list into two equal sub-lists: [6,3] and [9,1]
6. Split the fifth sub-list into two equal sub-lists: [2,0] and [1,2]
7. Split the sixth sub-list into two equal sub-lists: [9,4] and [7,8] 
Only output the 4 results in format {"0":..., "1": ...} without any addtional text or thoughts.</Instruction>
