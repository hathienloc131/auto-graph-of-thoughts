1. Find the length of the input list:  
len([0, 0, 5, 9, 0, 7, 9, 9, 1, 2, 6, 1, 1, 9, 0, 1, 3, 5, 2, 3, 5, 6, 0, 2, 7, 4, 6, 2, 9, 7, 5, 9])  
Correction: The length of the input list is 32.

2. Calculate the midpoint to divide the list into two equal subtasks:  
midpoint = len(input_list) // 2  
Correction: The midpoint for this list is 32 // 2 = 16.

3. Split the input list into two subtasks based on the calculated midpoint:  
subtask1 = input_list[:midpoint]  
subtask2 = input_list[midpoint:]  
Correction:  
subtask1 = [0, 0, 5, 9, 0, 7, 9, 9, 1, 2, 6, 1, 1, 9, 0, 1]  
subtask2 = [3, 5, 2, 3, 5, 6, 0, 2, 7, 4, 6, 2, 9, 7, 5, 9]  

Now you have successfully divided the list into two equal subtasks for sorting.

Attempt 1: 

1. Calculate the length of the given list:
   - Total number of elements in the list: 32

2. Determine the midpoint of the list by dividing the total number of elements by 2:
   - Midpoint = 32 / 2 = 16

3. Create two sublists by splitting the original list at the midpoint:
   - Sublist 1 (first half): [5, 6, 2, 3, 1, 4, 9, 0, 5, 7, 0, 7, 1, 3, 2, 4]
   - Sublist 2 (second half): [5, 5, 6, 6, 3, 6, 4, 4, 2, 3, 7, 1, 7, 0, 2, 5]

Attempt 2: 

1. Count the total number of elements in the list.
2. Divide the total count by 2 to find the midpoint.
3. Split the list at the midpoint to create two equal subtasks.

Let's follow these steps for the given input:
1. The total number of elements in the list is 31.
2. 31 divided by 2 equals 15.5, but since we can't have a half element in each subtask, let's round down to 15.
3. Split the list into two subtasks at index 15 to create two equal subtasks:
   Subtask 1: [9, 6, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4, 7, 9, 3, 6, 5, 0, 8, 1]

Attempt 3: 

1. **Count the total number of elements in the given list.**
   - In this case, the total number of elements in the given list is 32.

2. **Calculate half the length of the list to determine the midpoint for splitting.**
   - Since the total number of elements is 32, half of 32 is 16. This will be the midpoint for dividing the list into two equal sublists.

3. **Split the list into two sublists based on the calculated midpoint.**
   - The first sublist will contain elements from index 0 to 15.
   - The second sublist will contain elements from index 16 to 31.

4. **Verify that both resultant sublists have an equal number of elements.**
   - Check the length of both sublists to ensure they each contain 16 elements.
   - If the lengths are not equal, adjust the splitting point accordingly to divide the list into two equal parts. 

5. **Confirm that the two sublists are now separate and contain half of the elements each.**
   - Check the content of both sublists to ensure they are correctly divided from the original list.

By following these steps, you will successfully divide the given list into two equal sublists.

Attempt 8: 

1. Calculate the length of the input list: 
   - The input list has 32 elements.

2. Divide the length of the input list by 2 to find the midpoint: 
   - 32 / 2 = 16 

3. Use the midpoint to split the input list into two sublists:
   - First sublist: [6, 6, 9, 1, 7, 3, 5, 9, 7, 9, 1, 4, 8, 2, 5, 7]
   - Second sublist: [0, 8, 8, 8, 9, 8, 1, 0, 5, 6, 5, 9, 2, 1, 7, 7]

Attempt 11: 

1. Calculate the length of the input list to determine the midpoint for splitting it into two equal sublists. The length of the input list is 32 in this case.
2. Divide the length of the list by 2 to find the midpoint for splitting. 32 divided by 2 is 16.
3. Use slicing to create two sublists. The first sublist will contain elements from index 0 up to (but not including) the midpoint (index 16). The second sublist will contain elements from the midpoint (index 16) to the end of the list.
4. The two equal sublists will be:
   - First sublist: [4, 1, 7, 1, 8, 8, 7, 5, 7, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 4, 4]
   - Second sublist: [0, 0, 3, 3, 5, 6, 9, 3, 4, 9, 9, 2, 3, 0, 5, 5]

Now you have successfully divided the input list into two equal sublists as required.

1. Create two pointers, one for each sorted list, starting at the beginning of each list.
2. Compare the elements at the current positions of the two pointers.
3. Append the smaller element to a new list and move the pointer of the list from which the element was taken.
4. Repeat step 2 and 3 until both lists have been fully processed.
5. If any elements are remaining in either list, simply append them to the end of the new list as they are already sorted.
6. The new list will now be a combined sorted list of the two input lists. 

The corrected combined sorted list should look like this: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9].

Attempt 14: 

1. First, check the number of elements in the input list to ensure it can be divided into two equal subtasks.
   - Number of elements in the INPUT list: 32

2. Since the number of elements is even (32), we can divide the list into two equal subtasks of 16 elements each.

3. Divide the INPUT list into two equal subtasks:
   - Subtask 1: [3, 4, 7, 1, 9, 8, 3, 0, 6, 4, 4, 1, 9, 9, 9, 2]
   - Subtask 2: [8, 4, 7, 4, 7, 9, 7, 6, 9, 7, 2, 1, 4, 5, 3, 1]
   
4. Sort each subtask separately:
   - Subtask 1 sorted: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, 9]
   - Subtask 2 sorted: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 9, 9]

Now you have successfully divided the list into two equal subtasks and sorted each subtask separately.

STEP 2: Merge the two sorted sublists back together to get the final sorted list:
   - Start with two pointers, one for each sublist, pointing to the first element in each sublist.
   - Compare the elements at the pointers and append the smaller element to the final sorted list.
   - Move the pointer of the sublist from which the element was appended.
   - Repeat the comparison and appending process until all elements from both sublists are merged into the final sorted list.

Attempt 15: 

STEP 1: Sort the list in ascending order to make it easier to divide into two equal sublists.
CORRECTION: Sorting the list helps in identifying the mid-point to divide the list into two equal sublists.

STEP 2: Find the total number of elements in the list.
CORRECTION: This step helps determine the mid-point of the list for splitting into two equal sublists.

STEP 3: Calculate the midpoint by dividing the total number of elements by 2.
CORRECTION: Dividing the total number of elements by 2 gives us the index at which we will split the list into two equal sublists.

STEP 4: Split the list at the calculated midpoint to create two sublists.
CORRECTION: Make sure to split the list into two sublists at the calculated midpoint to separate the numbers based on their values.

Attempt 17: 

1. Check the total number of elements in the input list.
   - Input: [7, 5, 1, 8, 1, 5, 9, 6, 0, 9, 8, 2, 1, 2, 7, 4, 5, 7, 3, 7, 8, 5, 1, 0, 4, 7, 8, 1, 4, 1, 4, 2]
   - Total elements: 32

2. Calculate the midpoint to divide the list into two equal sublists.
   - Midpoint = Total elements / 2
   - Midpoint = 32 / 2
   - Midpoint = 16

3. Divide the list into two sublists at the midpoint to sort separately.
   - First sublist: [7, 5, 1, 8, 1, 5, 9, 6, 0, 9, 8, 2, 1, 2, 7, 4]
   - Second sublist: [5, 7, 3, 7, 8, 5, 1, 0, 4, 7, 8, 1, 4, 1, 4, 2]

Attempt 21: 

**Step 1:** Divide the list into two equal subtasks. Since the input list has 32 elements, each subtask will have 16 elements.
- Subtask 1: [6, 6, 4, 0, 7, 9, 5, 2, 0, 4, 2, 4, 8, 4, 0, 3]
- Subtask 2: [7, 0, 4, 3, 7, 0, 4, 3, 1, 3, 0, 1, 9, 6, 7, 4, 9, 1, 3, 0]

**Step 2:** Sort each subtask individually.
- Subtask 1 after sorting: [0, 0, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9]
- Subtask 2 after sorting: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 6, 7, 7, 9, 9]

STEP 2: Divide the length of the input list by 2 to find the midpoint. 

Midpoint = 32 / 2 = 16

STEP 3: Split the input list into two equal subtasks at the midpoint. 

First subtask: [8, 5, 0, 3, 6, 5, 6, 5, 4, 8, 0, 0, 7, 3, 9, 2]
Second subtask: [9, 2, 0, 4, 1, 0, 5, 5, 8, 2, 8, 4, 4, 3, 5, 1]

Now you have successfully divided the input list into two equal subtasks by splitting it in half.

Attempt 26: 

Step 1: Verify the length of the input list.
       - The length of the input list is 32.

Step 2: Calculate the midpoint by dividing the length of the list by 2.
       - Midpoint = 32 / 2 = 16

Step 3: Split the input list at the midpoint to create two sublists.

Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions to sort the two subtasks separately using any sorting algorithm for the given input:

1. Define the two subtasks based on the input. The two subtasks are:
   - Subtask 1: [9, 4, 6, 6, 9]
   - Subtask 2: [7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 1, 1, 4]

2. Choose a sorting algorithm to use for sorting the subtasks. Common sorting algorithms include Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc. For simplicity, let's use the Bubble Sort algorithm in this case.

3. Sort Subtask 1 using the chosen sorting algorithm (Bubble Sort in this case):
   - Subtask 1 before sorting: [9, 4, 6, 6, 9]
   - Subtask 1 after sorting: [4, 6, 6, 9, 9]

4. Double check the sorted Subtask 1 to ensure correctness.

5. Sort Subtask 2 using the same sorting algorithm (Bubble Sort):
   - Subtask 2 before sorting: [7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 1, 1, 4]
   - Subtask 2 after sorting: [1, 1, 4, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9]

6. Double check the sorted Subtask 2 to ensure correctness.

After following these steps, you should have successfully sorted the two subtasks separately using the chosen sorting algorithm.

Attempt 31: 

1. Calculate the total number of elements in the list. In this case, there are 32 elements in the list.
2. Divide the total number of elements by 2 to find the number of elements in each subtask. 32 / 2 = 16
3. Split the list into two equal subtasks of 16 elements each.

Step 1: Identify the two equal subtasks in the input.
- Equal subtasks are tasks that are identical. In this case, the input is [4, 2, 6, 4, 7, 2, 5, 2, 8, 4, 9, 5, 7, 7, 3, 2].
- Identify that the two equal subtasks are [4, 2, 6, 4, 7, 2, 5, 2] and [8, 4, 9, 5, 7, 7, 3, 2].

Step 2: Sort each subtask separately.
- Sort the first subtask [4, 2, 6, 4, 7, 2, 5, 2]: After sorting, the subtask becomes [2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7].
- Sort the second subtask [8, 4, 9, 5, 7, 7, 3, 2]: After sorting, the subtask becomes [2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 7, 8, 9].

Step 3: Double-check the sorted subtasks for accuracy.
- Check if both sorted subtasks are in ascending order.
- Confirm that the first sorted subtask is [2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7].
- Confirm that the second sorted subtask is [2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 7, 8, 9].
- Make sure all values are correctly sorted in each subtask.

Now, you have successfully sorted the two equal subtasks separately.

Attempt 33: 

1. Check the length of the input list to ensure it is even. If it is not even, you may need to adjust the list or handling the remaining element separately.

2. Calculate the midpoint of the list by dividing the length of the list by 2. 

3. Slice the input list into two subtasks using the calculated midpoint. First subtask will contain elements from index 0 to midpoint-1, and the second subtask will contain elements from midpoint to the end of the list.

4. Now you have two equal subtasks for sorting.

1. Count the total number of elements in the input list.
   - Correction: There are 32 elements in the list.

2. Calculate half of the total number of elements to determine the size of each subtask.
   - Correction: Half of 32 is 16, so each subtask should contain 16 elements.

3. Split the input list into two equal subtasks.
   - Correction:

2. Since there are 31 elements, we can divide the list into two equal sublists by splitting at index 15 (if we start indexing at 0).
3. Extract the first sublist by taking elements from index 0 to 14: [6, 6, 0, 8, 0, 6, 8, 4, 9, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 7]
4. Extract the second sublist by taking elements from index 15 to 30: [1, 5, 0, 9, 1, 9, 9, 8, 1, 5, 3, 2, 2, 7, 0, 5, 6]

- `index1` to 0 to keep track of the index of the first sublist.
- `index2` to 0 to keep track of the index of the second sublist.

STEP 2: Compare the elements at indices `index1` and `index2` from the two input lists. Append the smaller element to the `final_list` and increment the index of the sublist from which the element was taken.

STEP 3: Repeat Step 2 until one of the sublists is fully merged into the `final_list`.

STEP 4: Append the remaining elements from the sublist that is not fully merged into the `final_list`.

STEP 5: Append any remaining elements from the other sublist that were not added during merging.

STEP 6: Finally, you will have the combined sorted list in the `final_list` variable.

Attempt 37: 

1. Start by taking the provided list:
```
[9, 5, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 4, 4, 6, 1, 9, 4, 8, 0, 9, 4, 0, 5, 1, 9, 5, 6, 7, 9, 1, 2, 7, 1, 3, 9, 6]
```
2. Determine the length of the list. In this case, the length of the list is 32 elements.
3. Divide the list into two equal sublists. Since the length of the list is 32, each sublist will have 16 elements.
4. Here are the two equal sublists:
```
Sublist 1: [9, 5, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 4, 4, 6, 1, 9, 4, 8, 0, 9]
Sublist 2: [4, 0, 5, 1, 9, 5, 6, 7, 9, 1, 2, 7, 1, 3, 9, 6]

1. Identify the two sorted sublists within the input:
   - Sublist 1: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 4]
   - Sublist 2: [5, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9]

2. Create a new empty list to store the merged sorted list.

3. Initialize two pointers, one for each sublist:
   - Pointer 1 starting at the first element of Sublist 1.
   - Pointer 2 starting at the first element of Sublist 2.

4. Compare the elements at the pointers of each sublist:
   - If the element at Pointer 1 is less than or equal to the element at Pointer 2, add the element at Pointer 1 to the new sorted list and move Pointer 1 to the next element in Sublist 1.
   - If the element at Pointer 1 is greater than the element at Pointer 2, add the element at Pointer 2 to the new sorted list and move Pointer 2 to the next element in Sublist 2.

5. Repeat step 4 until you have iterated through all elements in both sublists.

6. If there are any remaining elements in Sublist 1 or Sublist 2 after completing step 5, add them to the end of the new sorted list.

7. The new sorted list will now contain all elements from both original sublists in a sorted order:
   - Merged sorted list: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9]

Double-check each step to ensure correct merging of the two sublists into a single sorted list.

Sure, here are the steps to merge the two sorted sublists into a single sorted list:

1. Identify the two sorted sublists within the input list. In this case, the two sublists are [0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7, 9, 9, 9, 9].
2. Split the two sublists into separate lists. Let's call them sublist1 and sublist2.
3. Define an empty list to store the merged sorted list. Let's call it merged_list.
4. Compare the first elements of both sublist1 and sublist2.
5. Add the smaller of the two elements to the merged_list.
6. Remove the element added from its respective sublist.
7. Repeat steps 4-6 until all elements from both sublists are merged into the merged_list.
8. Double-check the final merged_list to ensure it is sorted and contains all elements from the original sublists.

Attempt 39: 

1. Count the total number of elements in the input list: In this case, there are 31 elements in the list.
2. Calculate the midpoint of the list by dividing the total number of elements by 2: 31 / 2 = 15.5
3. Since the midpoint is a decimal number, round it up to the nearest whole number: 15.5 rounded up is 16.
4. Split the list into two sublists at the 16th element to create two equal sublists.
5. First sublist: [6, 1, 6, 5, 7, 1, 6, 3, 8, 7, 6, 1, 3, 8, 6]
6. Second sublist: [9, 3, 1, 1, 9, 4, 8, 3, 1, 9, 4, 5, 9, 5, 4, 1, 8]

After following these steps, you have successfully divided the input list into two equal sublists.

3. Using your preferred method (e.g., bubble sort, quicksort, merge sort), sort the sublist in ascending or descending order. Let's use bubble sort method for this example.
4. Apply the bubble sort algorithm on the sublist. Compare each pair of adjacent elements and swap them if they are in the wrong order. Repeat this process until the sublist is sorted completely.
5. After applying the bubble sort algorithm, the sorted sublist should be: [1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9].

Attempt 43: 

1. First, count the total number of elements in the list. In this case, there are 31 elements.
2. To divide the list into two equal subtasks, calculate the midpoint of the list by dividing the total number of elements by 2. In this case, 31 divided by 2 equals 15.5, so the midpoint is between the 15th and 16th elements.
3. Round down the midpoint to get the index where you will split the list. The 15th element will be the last element in the first subtask and the 16th element will be the first element in the second subtask.
4. Perform the split on the list:
   - First subtask: [7, 7, 7, 8, 7, 9, 4, 3, 5, 5, 1, 7, 7, 4, 0]
   - Second subtask: [5, 6, 2, 7, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 0, 8, 6, 7, 8, 4, 6, 4]

Attempt 45: 

1. First, count the total number of elements in the INPUT list:
- Total elements in INPUT list: 32

2. Calculate the midpoint to divide the list into two equal subtasks:
- Midpoint = Total elements divided by 2
- Midpoint = 32 / 2 = 16

3. Split the INPUT list into two equal subtasks at the midpoint:
- First subtask: [1, 8, 6, 5, 0, 6, 2, 4, 2, 2, 0, 8, 7, 6, 1, 3]
- Second subtask: [1, 9, 7, 5, 9, 8, 1, 8, 2, 7, 7, 3, 7, 7, 8, 7]

Now you have successfully divided the list into two equal subtasks for sorting.

1. Take a look at your two sorted lists:
    - List 1: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8]
    - List 2: [1, 1, 5, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 2, 3, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8]

2. Now, merge these two lists into a single sorted list. Start with an empty list to hold the combined sorted values.

3. Compare the first elements of both lists: 0 and 1. Since 0 is smaller, add it to the new list and move to the next element in List 1.

4. Next, compare 0 and 1, again adding the smaller element, which is 0, to the new list and advancing in List 1.

5. Keep comparing and adding the smaller element until you have merged all elements from both lists into a single sorted list.

6. After merging all elements, you should have a new sorted list combining the elements from both of the previous lists: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 1, 1, 5, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 2, 3, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8]. 

7. Next, check the list to ensure all elements are in ascending order, making any necessary adjustments if needed. 

8. Finally, your new sorted list should be: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9].

Attempt 47: 

Sure! Here are the step-by-step instructions to divide the list into two equal sublists:

1. Calculate the length of the input list.
   - In this case, the length of the input list is 32.

2. Determine the midpoint index by dividing the length of the list by 2.
   - Midpoint index = 32 / 2 = 16

3. Create two sublists by splitting the input list at the midpoint index.
   - First sublist: [9, 6, 0, 1, 8, 4, 9, 6, 3, 6, 0, 7, 0, 8, 9]
   - Second sublist: [3, 6, 6, 9, 3, 2, 2, 2, 9, 4, 9, 3, 8, 1, 9, 6, 1]

1. First, let's merge the two sublists into one list. 
2. The given input contains one sublist, so we will not be merging any sublists.
3. Now, the list to be sorted is: [0, 5, 6, 4, 6, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2, 8, 8, 6, 7, 8, 9].
4. Let's proceed to sorting this list.

STEP 1: Determine the midpoint index of the sorted list. In this case, since the list has 13 elements, the midpoint index is 6 (starting from 0).
CORRECTION: The midpoint index should be 6 (inclusive), not 5.

STEP 2: Create two empty lists to store the two subtasks after splitting at the midpoint index.
CORRECTION: No errors in this step.

STEP 3: Split the sorted list at the midpoint index into two subtasks. The left subtask will include elements from index 0 to 6, and the right subtask will include elements from index 7 to 12.
CORRECTION: The right subtask should include elements from index 7 to 12, not 8 to 12 as previously stated.

STEP 4: Merge the two subtasks back together into a single sorted list by comparing elements from both subtasks and adding them to a new list in the correct order.
CORRECTION: No errors in this step.

STEP 5: The merged sorted list should now be: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8].

    - Second sublist: [5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9]

2. Create a new empty list to store the merged sorted list.

3. Initialize two pointer variables, one for each sublist:
    - Pointer for the first sublist (pointer_1) at index 0.
    - Pointer for the second sublist (pointer_2) at index 0.

4. Compare the elements at the pointers of each sublist:
    - If the element at pointer_1 is less than the element at pointer_2, append the element at pointer_1 to the new list and increment pointer_1 by 1.
    - If the element at pointer_2 is less than or equal to the element at pointer_1, append the element at pointer_2 to the new list and increment pointer_2 by 1.

5. Repeat step 4 until you reach the end of either sublist.

6. Append the remaining elements of the sublist that has not reached its end to the new list.

1. First, ensure that the two input lists are already sorted. Check that the lists are sorted in ascending order to proceed with combining them.

2. Create an empty list to store the combined sorted elements. Let's name it `sorted_combined_list`.

3. Initialize two pointers, one for each input list, starting at the beginning of each list. Let's name the pointers `pointer1` for the first list and `pointer2` for the second list.

4. Compare the elements at `pointer1` in the first list and `pointer2` in the second list. Append the smaller of the two elements to the `sorted_combined_list`.

5. Move the pointer of the list from which the element was appended to the next position.

6. Repeat the comparison and appending process while both pointers are within the bounds of their respective lists.

7. If one of the lists reaches the end, append the remaining elements from the other list to the `sorted_combined_list`.

8. Finally, you will have a new sorted list combining the elements of the two input lists. Double-check to ensure that the `sorted_combined_list` is indeed sorted in ascending order.

Attempt 54: 

1. Determine the length of the input list:
   Count the number of elements in the input list. In this case, the input list has 32 elements.

2. Calculate the midpoint to divide the list into two equal sublists:
   Divide the length of the input list by 2 to find the midpoint. In this case, 32 divided by 2 is 16.

3. Create two sublists by slicing the input list:
   Use slicing to divide the input list into two sublists. 
   The first sublist will be from index 0 to 15 (exclusive), and the second sublist will be from index 16 to the end.

Attempt 62: 

STEP 1: Calculate the length of the input list.
INPUT: [5, 0, 7, 6, 2, 6, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 3, 9, 5, 4, 9, 0, 0, 4, 9, 0, 3, 1, 4, 7, 5, 9, 8, 6, 0, 7, 3]

LENGTH = 32

STEP 2: Determine the midpoint of the list (half of the length calculated in Step 1).
MIDPOINT = 32 / 2 = 16

STEP 3: Split the list into two sublists using the midpoint calculated in Step 2.
SUBLIST_1 = [5, 0, 7, 6, 2, 6, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 3, 9, 5, 4, 9]
SUBLIST_2 = [0, 4, 9, 0, 3, 1, 4, 7, 5, 9, 8, 6, 0, 7, 3]

Now the list has been divided into two equal sublists.

2. Initialize three empty lists:
   - resultList to store the merged sorted list
   - index1 initialized to 0 to keep track of the current index in Sublist 1
   - index2 initialized to 0 to keep track of the current index in Sublist 2

3. Compare the elements at index1 and index2 in the two sublists:
   - If the element in Sublist 1 at index1 is smaller or equal to the element in Sublist 2 at index2, 
     append the element in Sublist 1 to the resultList and increment index1 by 1.
   - If the element in Sublist 1 at index1 is larger than the element in Sublist 2 at index2, 
     append the element in Sublist 2 to the resultList and increment index2 by 1.

4. Repeat step 3 until both sublists have been fully processed (index1 reaches the end of Sublist 1 and index2 reaches the end of Sublist 2).

5. If there are any remaining elements in Sublist 1 or Sublist 2 after completing step 4, 
   append those remaining elements to the resultList.

6. The resultList now contains the merged sorted list of the two sublists.

You should now have a single sorted list after performing these steps.

2. Determine the midpoint of the input list to separate the two sublists. In this case, the midpoint is at index 7, so the two sublists are [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3] and [4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8].
3. Merge the two sublists by comparing elements one by one and selecting the smaller element to form the new sorted list. Start comparing from the beginning of each sublist.
4. Go through each element of both sublists and add them in sorted order to create the final sorted list.
5. Double check the final sorted list to ensure all elements are in ascending order: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8].

2. Create a new empty list to store the combined sorted list.

3. Initialize two pointers, one for each list, starting at the first element of each list.

4. Compare the elements at the pointers from both lists.

5. Add the smaller element to the new list and move the pointer of the list from which the element was taken by one position.

6. Repeat the comparison and addition process until you reach the end of one of the lists.

7. Once one list is completely processed, add the remaining elements of the other list to the new list, as they are already sorted.

8. Check the final combined list to ensure it is properly sorted: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8]

2. Since you want to divide the list into two equal parts, the total number of elements divided by 2 should give us the number of elements in each part. In this case, 32 divided by 2 equals 16 elements in each part.
3. Split the input list into two equal parts of 16 elements each.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Attempt 65: 

1. Calculate the length of the input list:
   - Input: [3, 3, 7, 3, 2, 5, 7, 1, 4, 7, 0, 7, 1, 2, 5, 9, 6, 9, 5, 5, 0, 3, 2, 4, 1, 2, 0, 5, 5, 0, 1, 8]
   - Number of elements: 32
   
2. Divide the list into two equal parts:
   - First sublist: [3, 3, 7, 3, 2, 5, 7, 1, 4, 7, 0, 7, 1, 2, 5, 9, 6]
   - Second sublist: [9, 5, 5, 0, 3, 2, 4, 1, 2, 0, 5, 5, 0, 1, 8]
   
3. Check if both sublists have an equal number of elements:
   - First sublist length: 17
   - Second sublist length: 15
   - Modify the sublists to ensure they have an equal number of elements:
   
   - First sublist: [3, 3, 7, 3, 2, 5, 7, 1, 4, 7, 0, 7, 1, 2, 5, 9, 6]
   - Second sublist: [9, 5, 5, 0, 3, 2, 4, 1, 2, 0, 5, 5, 0, 1, 8]
   
4. Now you have two equal subtasks for sorting.

To sort each sublist separately in the provided INPUT, we will follow the following steps:
1. Go through each sublist one by one.
2. Apply a sorting algorithm (like bubble sort, selection sort, merge sort, etc.) to sort each sublist individually.
3. Once all sublists are sorted, combine them back in the original order.

Attempt 67: 

Step 1: Calculate the length of the input list.
- INPUT: [0, 7, 5, 5, 0, 3, 0, 7, 3, 9, 8, 3, 1, 2, 1, 5, 3, 6, 8, 7, 2, 9, 9, 6, 9, 2, 0, 1, 7, 9, 2, 0]
- Length of the input list: 32

Step 2: Calculate the midpoint for dividing the list into 2 equal subtasks.
- Midpoint = Length of the input list / 2
- Midpoint = 32 / 2 = 16

Step 3: Divide the input list into 2 equal subtasks.
- First subtask: [0, 7, 5, 5, 0, 3, 0, 7, 3, 9, 8, 3, 1, 2, 1, 5]
- Second subtask: [3, 6, 8, 7, 2, 9, 9, 6, 9, 2, 0, 1, 7, 9, 2, 0]

Now you have successfully divided the input list into 2 equal subtasks for sorting.

1. First, identify the two subtasks in the input provided:
   - Subtask 1: 
   - Subtask 2: 

2. For each subtask, arrange the items in ascending order:
   - Subtask 1:
   - Subtask 2:

3. Once you have sorted both subtasks, you can update the input with the sorted lists.

Let's start by identifying the items in each subtask and then proceed to sort them one by one. If you provide the actual items in each subtask, we can continue with the sorting process.

Attempt 72: 

1. First, count the total number of elements in the input list to determine how many elements each subtask should have. 
   - Total number of elements in the input list: 32
   - Each subtask should have 16 elements since we want to divide the list into two equal parts.

2. Next, divide the input list into two equal subtasks:
   - First subtask: [5, 1, 7, 2, 4, 5, 0, 2, 7, 2, 2, 9, 7, 0, 5, 8]
   - Second subtask: [5, 2, 2, 1, 2, 6, 9, 7, 8, 8, 4, 5, 1, 8, 2, 8]

3. Double-check to ensure that each subtask has half of the total elements:
   - First subtask has 16 elements: Correct
   - Second subtask has 16 elements: Correct

The list has now been successfully divided into two equal subtasks.

Attempt 74: 

1. Calculate the length of the input list:
   - Number of elements in the INPUT: 32
   
2. Divide the length of the input list by 2 to find the midpoint:
   - Midpoint = 32 / 2 = 16

3. Identify the indices at which the list will be split:
   - The list will be split at index 16, creating two equal sublists.

4. Create two sublists by splitting the input list at the calculated midpoint:
   - First sublist: [4, 3, 3, 0, 4, 7, 9, 4, 3, 5, 3, 5, 4, 2, 0, 2]

Attempt 76: 

1. First, count the total number of elements in the given list.
2. Since the list has 32 elements, we need to divide it into two equal sublists. 
3. Calculate the index where the split should occur by dividing the total number of elements by 2. In this case, 32 / 2 = 16.
4. Split the list at the 16th index to create two equal sublists. 
5. The first sublist will contain elements from index 0 to 15, and the second sublist will contain elements from index 16 to 31.

Attempt 78: 

1. Find the total number of elements in the input list: 32 elements.
2. Since we want to divide the list into two equal subtasks, divide the total number of elements by 2: 32 / 2 = 16.
3. Split the input list into two equal subtasks of 16 elements each. 

Here are the two equal subtasks:
Subtask 1: [3, 5, 5, 9, 6, 6, 6, 2, 9, 0, 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 6]

Attempt 79: 

Sure! Here are the step by step instructions:

1. Calculate the length of the input list. In this case, the length of the input list is 32.
2. Determine the midpoint of the list by dividing the length by 2. In this case, the midpoint is 16.
3. Split the input list into two sublists at the midpoint. The first sublist will contain elements from index 0 to 15, and the second sublist will contain elements from index 16 to 31.
4. Verify that both sublists have an equal number of elements. In this case, both sublists have 16 elements each.
5. The two equal sublists are as follows:
   First sublist: [9, 5, 9, 0, 4, 5, 6, 3, 0, 1, 4, 3, 1, 5, 9, 9]

Attempt 80: 

1. Calculate the length of the input list.
   **Error Check:** The input list contains 31 elements.
   
2. Divide the length of the list by 2 to find the index at which to split the list into two equal sublists.
   **Error Check:** 31 divided by 2 is 15.5; thus, the division should result in 15 to evenly split the list.
   
3. Use slicing to create two equal sublists from the input list based on the calculated midpoint index.
   **Error Check:** The first sublist should contain elements from index 0 to 14, and the second sublist should contain elements from index 15 to 30.

Attempt 81: 

1. Calculate the length of the input list.
   - There are 32 elements in the input list.

2. Divide the length of the list by 2 to find the midpoint.
   - Midpoint = 32 / 2 = 16

3. Split the input list into two equal subtasks at the midpoint:
   - First subtask: [8, 1, 1, 3, 0, 2, 8, 0, 9, 5, 3, 7, 7, 6, 8, 5]
   - Second subtask: [2, 9, 3, 2, 6, 4, 2, 1, 7, 9, 4, 0, 1, 9, 3, 0]

Now you have successfully divided the input list into two equal subtasks.

Attempt 84: 

1. Determine the length of the input list:
   - INPUT: [2, 5, 4, 9, 4, 5, 3, 8, 1, 5, 0, 4, 5, 5, 7, 4, 6, 6, 7, 7, 1, 9, 6, 5, 8, 6, 3, 6, 8, 9, 0, 7]
   - Total elements: 32

2. Calculate the midpoint to divide the list into 2 equal subtasks:
   - Midpoint = Total elements / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16

3. Divide the input list into two equal subtasks based on the midpoint:
   - First subtask: [2, 5, 4, 9, 4, 5, 3, 8, 1, 5, 0, 4, 5, 5, 7, 4]
   - Second subtask: [6, 6, 7, 7, 1, 9, 6, 5, 8, 6, 3, 6, 8, 9, 0, 7]

4. The list has been successfully divided into 2 equal subtasks for sorting. You can now proceed with sorting each subtask individually.

Attempt 87: 

1. First, verify the length of the input list to ensure it can be divided into two equal subtasks.
2. Divide the input list [6, 0, 1, 6, 6, 0, 7, 9, 2, 5, 8, 4, 5, 8, 1, 4, 8, 0, 6, 4, 0, 7, 1, 2, 3, 9, 4, 8, 7, 3, 8, 2] into two equal subtasks. Since the list has 32 elements, the two subtasks will each have 16 elements.
3. Sort the first subtask [6, 0, 1, 6, 6, 0, 7, 9, 2, 5, 8, 4, 5, 8, 1, 4] separately.
4. Sort the second subtask [8, 0, 6, 4, 0, 7, 1, 2, 3, 9, 4, 8, 7, 3, 8, 2] separately.
5. Double-check that both subtasks are sorted correctly: 
   - First subtask: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9]
   - Second subtask: [0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9]

Input list: [3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 9, 8, 7, 3, 9, 7, 0, 4, 0, 9, 4, 3, 7, 5, 1, 9, 5, 6, 6, 6, 3, 6, 3, 2, 8, 6, 8]
Length of the input list: 32

2. Divide the length of the list by 2 to determine the midpoint:
Midpoint = 32 / 2 = 16

3. Create two sublists by splitting the input list at the midpoint index:
Sublist 1: [3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 9, 8, 7, 3, 9, 7, 0, 4, 0, 9, 4]
Sublist 2: [3, 7, 5, 1, 9, 5, 6, 6, 6, 3, 6, 3, 2, 8, 6, 8]

Double check the steps to ensure that the input list has been divided into two equal subtasks for sorting, each with 16 elements.

Sure, here are the step by step instructions to perform the task of sorting the original list using the merge sort algorithm:

1. Merge the results of TASK 1 and TASK 2 into a single list. Remove duplicates and keep the elements sorted.
   - Combined List: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9]

2. Implement the merge sort algorithm on the combined list:
   - Here's how the merge sort algorithm works:
     a. Divide the list into two halves.
     b. Recursively sort each half.
     c. Merge the sorted halves back together.

3. Apply the merge sort algorithm to the combined list [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9]:
   - Divide the list into halves: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5] and [6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9]
   - Recursively sort each half:
     - Sort [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5] -> [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5]
     - Sort [6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9] -> [6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9]
   - Merge the sorted halves back together: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9]

4. The final sorted list using the merge sort algorithm is:
   - Sorted List: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9]

By following these steps, you will successfully sort the original list using the merge sort algorithm.

   - Sublist 3: [9, 9, 9, 9]

2. Sort each sublist in ascending order:
   - Sublist 1: [6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7] (No changes needed)
   - Sublist 2: [8, 8, 8, 8] (No changes needed)
   - Sublist 3: [9, 9, 9, 9] (No changes needed)

3. Updated sorted sublists in ascending order:
   - Sublist 1: [6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7]
   - Sublist 2: [8, 8, 8, 8]
   - Sublist 3: [9, 9, 9, 9]

The sublists have been sorted in ascending order.

STEP 1: Create an empty list to store the combined sorted list.  
STEP 2: Initialize two pointers to track the current index of each sublist (starting from the first element).  
STEP 3: Compare the elements at the current indices of both sublists.  
STEP 4: Append the smaller element to the combined sorted list and move the pointer of the sublist from which the element was taken to the next index.  
STEP 5: Repeat step 3 and step 4 until all elements from both sublists have been added to the combined sorted list.  
STEP 6: If there are any remaining elements in either sublist, add them to the end of the combined sorted list.  
STEP 7: Double check to make sure the combined list is sorted correctly.  
RESULT: Combined sorted list: [0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9]
