["Annie, a marine biologist from Ireland, had always been fascinated by the diverse sealife surrounding the coasts of Australia. She often said that the waters of Australia were some of the most biodiverse in the world, enticing researchers like her from faraway lands like Ireland. Through her explorations, she developed a particular interest in the migratory patterns of certain species, noting that they often ventured towards New Zealand. Annie noticed that from Australia, these marine creatures would cross oceans to reach the coasts of New Zealand, proving the interconnectedness \nof these ecosystems. Driven by this curiosity, she published \nher research, attracting the attention of a fellow scientist, Greg, \nfrom Canada. Inspired by her findings, Greg \nshared his own studies on migration patterns, noting a \nsimilar scenario between Canada and the United States. \nHe'd found that many animal species in Canada would cross \nthe border into the United States during certain seasons, \nemphasizing the interplay between these two nations. \nAnnie and Greg started to collaborate, which led their research \ntowards Mexico, where they discovered another fascinating \nmigration phenomenon.

1. store the first substring in text
2. reassign text to lower case as country names won't be case sensitive when stored as dictionary key
3. create a dictionary called countries and initialize all keys with 0 as their value, meaning no country has any frequency yet
4. Split the text by the word separator and initialize a variable called last_word to store the last split word to correct it as it won't contain a period at the end which is how all other split words end with
5. Loop over the splits and if split is not equal last_word, correct the last_word to the split, then if last_word ends with a period, check if it exists in the countries dictionary keys, otherwise add it and add 1 to its frequency, else simply add 1 to its frequency
6. print the dictionary as countries do not repeat therefore their frequencies equal their appearance in the string

Maria's research had shown that just like the animals in North America, the Lynx in Spain had established territories in Portugal. Intrigued by the similarities, they expanded their study to cover the movement of bird species between Belgium and the Netherlands. Just as they'd seen in the Americas, they noticed that certain species of birds in Belgium would travel to the Netherlands during certain periods of the year. These fascinating findings opened up new dimensions of understanding for the interconnectedness of the world. From the sealife in Australia to the birds in Belgium, the animal kingdom had its own ways of establishing connections between countries.'.

Attempt 5: 

1. **Read about Splitting Lists in Python.** Here's how you can achieve this:

   ```python
   # Define the input list
   input_list = "On his journey across the globe, Mark found himself fascinated by the cultural blend in Argentina where the tango originated. His time in Argentina sparked his interest in Brazil, and he took a short plane ride to the country known for its vast Amazon rainforest. The allure of Brazil was intoxicating, its vibrant festivals and unique wildlife were unlike anything he'd previously seen. He'd soon learn that the wildlife in Australia, however, was equally captivating. While in Australia, Mark found himself charmed by the affectionate kangaroos and aloof koalas. After Australia, he headed towards Asia, beginning at the vibrant country of India. India's cultural diversity, historical grandeur, and the warmth of the people enticed him to spend more time exploring the country. Another country that captured his heart in the same way was China, with its rich history and splendid landscapes. China amazed him with its ancient monuments and the Great Wall, leaving him yearning for more such experiences. Such yearning led him to Egypt, home to the majestic Pyramids. The history and mysteries that shrouded Egypt kept him intrigued, so much so that he extended his stay. Encouraged by his experiences in Egypt, Mark decided to venture further into the landscapes of Africa and arrived at Kenya. In Kenya, he was awestruck by the vast savannahs and spectacular wildlife. His adventures in Kenya made him realize the untapped beauty of Africa, prompting him to extend his African journey to South Africa. In South Africa, he was spellbound by the natural beauty of the landscapes, making him fall in love with Africa. His next destination was Europe, where he found himself fascinated by the architectural grandeur of Italy and the historical stories that surrounded every alleyway. Italy, with its enchanting cities and delicious food, left an unforgettable impression on him. The final leg of his journey led him to cold but beautiful Norway, where he witnessed the spectacular Northern Lights, ending his journey on a high note."

   # Calculate the length of the list
   list_length = len(input_list)

   # Determine the number of parts to split the list into
   num_parts = 4

   # Calculate the size of each part
   part_size = list_length // num_parts

   # Create a list to store the split parts
   split_lists = []

   # Iterate over the list and add each part to the split_lists
   for i in range(0, list_length, part_size):
       split_lists.append(input_list[i:i + part_size])

   # Print the split lists
   print(split_lists)
   ```

2. **Check your understanding.** Ensure you fully understand the concepts of splitting lists in Python, including the use of the `len()` function to determine the length of a list, integer division (`//`) to calculate the size of each part, and the `range()` function to iterate over the list in chunks.

3. **Test your code.** Try running the code with different input lists to verify that it correctly splits them into equal parts.

4. **Refine your code.** Based on your understanding and testing, you can refine your code for clarity, efficiency, and error handling.

Here are a few resources that you may find helpful:

The food of Mexico, in particular, was a revelation to her. After Mexico, she headed to France. France's elegance, be it in their language, fashion, or gastronomy, left her fascinated. She spent hours sitting in cafes in France, watching the world go by, and feeling a sense of peace that she hadn't felt for a long time. After France, her journey took her to the far East, to China. In China, she found a dynamic cityscape intermingling with centuries-old architecture. China’s history fascinated her, and her journey through the country felt like traveling through time. Her last stop was Australia and she spent weeks exploring the diverse landscapes of the country. From the bustling cities to the serene Outback, Australia was a beautiful end to her travels. Her experiences in Japan, Ireland, Brazil, Mexico, France, China, and Australia had given her a new perspective, a deeper appreciation for the beauty in diversity.'.

- INPUT: "The parchments spoke of a time when merchants from Portugal would regularly travel to Spain for trade and cultural exchange, hinting at a deeply entwined history between Portugal and Spain."

- Word List: ["The", "parchments", "spoke", "of", "a", "time", "when", "merchants", "from", "Portugal", "would", "regularly", "travel", "to", "Spain", "for", "trade", "and", "cultural", "exchange", "hinting", "at", "a", "deeply", "entwined", "history", "between", "Portugal", "and", "Spain"]

**STEP 3:** Iterate through the word list.

- Current Word: "The"
- Check if "The" is the same as the country we want to count ("Portugal").
- "The" is not equal to "Portugal", so we skip this word.

- Current Word: "parchments"
- Check if "parchments" is the same as the country we want to count ("Portugal").
- "parchments" is not equal to "Portugal", so we skip this word.

- ... (Continue iterating through the word list)

- Current Word: "Portugal"
- Check if "Portugal" is the same as the country we want to count ("Portugal").
- "Portugal" is equal to "Portugal", so we increment its count in the dictionary.

- Updated Dictionary: {"Spain": 1, "Portugal": 1}

**STEP 4:** Repeat Step 3 for all words in the list.

- We increment the count of "Portugal" again when we encounter the word "Portugal" later in the sentence.

The text painted images of South Africa's mesmerizing coastlines and diverse wildlife that had always enchanted Thomas, who had a particular fondness for this unique and captivating land. His fascination for South Africa led him to discuss his interest with his friend Maria, who hailed from Brazil. During their conversation, Maria started reminiscing about her visit to Mexico where she discovered a rich culture steeped in history. There seemed to be a silent agreement that Mexico, with its vibrant traditions and ancient Mayan ruins, was a country that intrigued them both. Maria also revealed her fascination for Argentina, pointing out its dynamic cities and beautiful landscapes. Thomas quickly chimed in, saying he too had always wanted to explore Argentina, enthralled by its history, and was planning a trip soon. The discussion soon veered towards Thomas's recent trip to Belgium, where he was impressed by its medieval towns and gothic architecture. Maria, too, expressed her interest in Belgium, particularly fascinated by the intricate lacework and delicious chocolates. Their conversation then took a turn towards the Far East, with Maria excitedly talking about her unforgettable experiences in Japan.

Among these artifacts are rare gems and stones that were once believed to have been imported from Egypt and were a sign of Italy's prosperous trade with Egypt. Speaking of gemstones, Jim remembered his visit to South Africa, where he had learnt about diamond mining. As he discovered, diamonds were not only mined in South Africa, but also in neighboring Zimbabwe. The vast diamond mines in both South Africa and Zimbabwe are a testament to the abundant mineral wealth these countries hold. While discussing his travels, Jim's friend Lisa spoke of her fascinating visit to China. She recalled how she was in awe of the Great Wall of China, which demonstrated the country's rich history and the military might of ancient China. While in China, she also learned about the country's historical connections with North Korea. It seems China and North Korea have shared cultural and political ties for centuries. Recalling her travels, Lisa mentioned her trip to Ireland where she had discovered the ancient history of the Celtic people. She also pointed out that the connection between Ireland and the United Kingdom is not just geographical but also deeply historical. The shared history and cultural exchanges between Ireland and the United Kingdom have shaped the identities of both nations.

```
STEP 1: Split the paragraph into a list of complete sentences by finding full stops in each sentence. We obtain the following list of sentences after splitting with full stops.
```python
sentences = paragraph.split('.')

```
STEP 2: For each sentence that does not end with a full stop, append a full stop to it, and add it to the list.
```python
for sentence in sentences:
    if not sentence.endswith('.'):
        sentence += '.'
        sentences.append(sentence)
```
STEP 3: Now iterate over the sentences to detect the names of countries. First, replace the substring "the " with an empty string in each sentence.
```python
sentences = [sentence.replace('the ', '') for sentence in sentences]
```
STEP 4: Check for the existence of double spaces in any modified sentence; if it exists, replace it with a single space.
```python
sentences = [sentence.replace('  ', ' ') for sentence in sentences]
```
STEP 5:  The split() method is  used to divide each sentence based on whitespace.
```python
words_in_sentences = [sentence.split() for sentence in sentences]
```
STEP 6: Create a dictionary named `country_freq`, with the keys initialized as empty strings.
```python
country_freq = dict()
```
STEP 7: Iterate over the list `words_in_sentences` which contains all the words in all the sentences. For each substring being non-empty and containing alphabetic characters, update the frequency of the country in the dictionary.
```python
for words in words_in_sentences:
    for word in words:
        if word.isalpha():
            country_freq[word] = country_freq.get(word, 0) + 1
```

Next, he traveled to Ireland, a country known for its lush landscapes and rich folklore that reminded him of the verdant hills and vibrant culture of its neighbour, the United Kingdom. Struck by the similarities, he found that Ireland and the United Kingdom shared deep historical ties, language influences, and even traditional music. After Ireland, he ventured into the heart of Europe, finding himself in the charming lanes of Belgium. The intricate architecture and delicate cuisine of Belgium enticed him, and they seemed all the more familiar when he moved on to the Netherlands. He learned that Belgium and the Netherlands had shared monarchies and currencies in the past, highlighting a linked history. From there, his journey took him halfway across the globe to South Korea. The bustling cities and fascinating traditions of South Korea captivated him, and he noticed many similarities when he crossed the border into North Korea. Despite the political differences, he found cultural threads that connected South Korea and North Korea, from food to language. Looking back on his travels, John was intrigued by the deep-rooted ties between these pairs of countries: Argentina and Brazil, Iran and Iraq, Ireland and the United Kingdom, Belgium and the Netherlands, and South Korea and North Korea.'.

Attempt 21: 

**STEP 1:** Read the given paragraph carefully and identify all the countries mentioned in it.
**INPUT:** "Emma, a history teacher, recently visited Egypt for an archeological expedition where she unearthed coins from the ancient Egypt era bearing the emblem of Greece. These coins, she learnt, were a solid proof of a powerful alliance between Egypt and Greece during the period of Ptolemaic Pharaohs. Intrigued by her findings, her colleague David, a history enthusiast from Canada, stressed upon a similar historical connection between Canada and the United States. He explained that despite being two separate nations today, Canada and the United States share a common history of colonial times and have closely influenced each other's cultural development. Emma further shared her experience of visiting the breath-taking ruins of ancient Rome in Italy, where she had found scrolls mentioning strong trade relations between Italy and Spain. These scrolls showed that during the Roman era, Italy and Spain had a strong bond based on mutual respect and trade. David smiled and shared his own experience of visiting China, where he found evidence of a deep-rooted bond between China and Japan. During his tour in China, he saw ancient scrolls that depicted the cultural and philosophical exchanges between China and Japan. These exchanges played a crucial role in the development of their unique, yet interconnected, cultural identities. Intrigued by each other's narratives, Emma and David marvelled at how distant countries such as Greece and Japan, and closer ones like Canada and the United States, or Italy and Spain, were linked. They concluded that despite geographical boundaries, the world has always been a single interwoven tapestry of connected histories and cultures."
**COUNTRIES IDENTIFIED:** 
1. Egypt
2. Greece
3. Canada
4. United States
5. Italy
6. Spain

Both Brazil and Mexico, despite their geographical distance, shared legends of ancient gods and mythical creatures. Intriguingly, she mentioned the tales from New Zealand she had heard during her travels. Similar to Mexico and Brazil, New Zealand had its share of mythologies, but what fascinated her was the more modern link between the two regions - New Zealand and Australia. New Zealand, just like Australia, was known for its wild, untouched landscapes and unique wildlife. Their conversation then turned to the memories of her trip to Egypt.

Their research got a surprising twist when they discovered an old map, possibly hinting at the society's reach to the United States. Detailed around the map were accounts of clandestine operations carried out by the society, extending from the United States to Canada. The United States and Canada, owing to their geographical closeness and shared history, seemed like a plausible area of influence for this secret society. Their bond deepened when Eva shared her research about the society's ties with Argentina. She postulated that members from Argentina and Brazil could have been part of the society, due to certain cryptic symbols found in the ruins of both Argentina and Brazil. As their work progressed, they stumbled upon clues pointing towards the society's presence in the Middle East - specifically Iraq and Iran. It seemed, as confirmed from records found in Iraq, that through a series of underground networks, the society managed to infiltrate regions as far as Iran. As they delved deeper, they marveled at the society's widespread reach, from Poland to Iran, their narrative spun across continents and centuries to create an enthralling tale of history.'.

Go through the paragraph and count how many times each country is mentioned.

* India: 5
* Iran: 2
* China: 2
* Vietnam: 2
* France: 2
* Italy: 3
* United Kingdom: 1
* Ireland: 1

**STEP 2: Create a dictionary with the country as the key and the frequency as the value**

```
country_frequency = {
    "India": 5,
    "Iran": 2,
    "China": 2,
    "Vietnam": 2,
    "France": 2,
    "Italy": 3,
    "United Kingdom": 1,
    "Ireland": 1
}
```

**STEP 3: Sort the dictionary by frequency in descending order**

```
sorted_country_frequency = dict(sorted(country_frequency.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True))
```

The resulting dictionary `sorted_country_frequency` will have the countries sorted by their frequency of appearance in the paragraph.

["One evening, Sarah, an archaeologist from Norway, made a surprising discovery about ancient trade routes between Sweden and Norway. As per her research, the artifacts that were found in Norway were identical to those in Sweden, indicating a deep-rooted cultural connection between Sweden and Norway. This piqued the interest of her colleague, James, who was from Canada. He had been researching the indigenous tribes of Canada and found many similarities with tribes from his neighboring country, the United States. James had always been interested in the historical ties between Canada and United States, and his study further confirmed the age-old connections between the two countries.\n\nUpon hearing James's story, Sarah shared a fascinating anecdote from her travels in Portugal. She recalled how locals loved to tell the tale of the shared history between Spain and Portugal. Her anecdotes about Spain and Portugal echoed the same sense of shared culture and past, just like in the case of Norway and Sweden, and Canada and United States. Their conversation reminded James of his stay in South Korea, where he had learned about the close relationship between North Korea and South Korea, despite their current political divide. He recalled stories about the shared history of North Korea and South Korea, whose deep-seated cultural ties transcended political boundaries.\n\nSarah, who had been to Australia, reciprocated with her own experiences of the bond between Australia and New Zealand. She described how, despite geographical separation, Australia and New Zealand shared a unique camaraderie and close historical ties. As they exchanged stories, their conversation moved to South Africa and its various connections with its neighboring country, Zimbabwe. Sarah shared stories she had heard about the intricate bond between South Africa and Zimbabwe, showcasing the age-old interactions between these two nations. It left them both reflecting on the timeless bonds that connect nations across the world, from Norway to Australia, Canada to Zimbabwe, and all the countries in between.\n\nSarah, who had been to Australia, reciprocated with her own experiences of the bond between Australia and New Zealand.

James had always been interested in the historical ties between Canada and United States, and his study further confirmed the age-old connections between the two countries. Upon hearing James's story, Sarah shared a fascinating anecdote from her travels in Portugal. She recalled how locals loved to tell the tale of the shared history between Spain and Portugal. Her anecdotes about Spain and Portugal echoed the same sense of shared culture and past, just like in the case of Norway and Sweden, and Canada and United States. Their conversation reminded James of his stay in South Korea, where he had learned about the close relationship between North Korea and South Korea, despite their current political divide. He recalled stories about the shared history of North Korea and South Korea, whose deep-seated cultural ties transcended political boundaries. Sarah, who had been to Australia, reciprocated with her own experiences of the bond between Australia and New Zealand. She described how, despite geographical separation, Australia and New Zealand shared a unique camaraderie and close historical ties. As they exchanged stories, their conversation moved to South Africa and its various connections with its neighbouring country, Zimbabwe. Sarah shared stories she had heard about the intricate bond between South Africa and Zimbabwe, showcasing the age-old interactions between these two nations. It left them both reflecting on the timeless bonds that connect nations across the world, from Norway to Australia, Canada to Zimbabwe, and all the countries in between.'.

Through her explorations, she developed a particular interest in the migratory patterns of certain species, noting that they often ventured towards New Zealand. Annie noticed that from Australia, these marine creatures would cross oceans to reach the coasts of New Zealand, proving the interconnectedness of these ecosystems. Driven by this curiosity, she published her research, attracting the attention of a fellow scientist, Greg, from Canada. Inspired by her findings, Greg shared his own studies on migration patterns, noting a similar scenario between Canada and the United States. He'd found that many animal species in Canada would cross the border into the United States during certain seasons, emphasizing the interplay between these two nations. Annie and Greg started to collaborate, which led their research towards Mexico, where they discovered another fascinating migration phenomenon. They found it intriguing that birds from the United States would fly south, bypassing their own habitats to spend the winter in the warmer climates of Mexico. Their research in Mexico led them to another colleague, Maria, from Spain. Maria had been studying the movements of the Iberian Lynx which often roamed between Spain and Portugal. Maria's research had shown that just like the animals in North America, the Lynx in Spain had established territories in Portugal. Intrigued by the similarities, they expanded their study to cover the movement of bird species between Belgium and the Netherlands. Just as they'd seen in the Americas, they noticed that certain species of birds in Belgium would travel to the Netherlands during certain periods of the year. These fascinating findings opened up new dimensions of understanding for the interconnectedness of the world. From the sealife in Australia to the birds in Belgium, the animal kingdom had its own ways of establishing connections between countries.'.

She felt the powerful impact Spain has had on Mexico's language, food, and traditions during her stay in Mexico, which reminded her of the time when she was in Spain. Intriguingly, Emily's friend, Marc, an avid traveler himself, had fascinating stories about the subtle cultural ties between China and North Korea. Having lived in China for a few years, he noted that North Korea's strong cultural and political ties with China were evident in their shared festivals and traditional customs. His stories stirred a memory of Emily's own journey to Australia and New Zealand. The unity between Australia and New Zealand, carved by shared history and geographic proximity, had left a deep impression on her. Their adventurous spirits and friendly rivalry had always amazed her, much like the lively competition between Argentina and Brazil. She was fascinated by the healthy sporting rivalry between Argentina and Brazil, and how it symbolized the love and unity between these two nations. Marc then spoke about his recent travels to Sweden and Norway. His account of the breathtaking landscapes of Sweden and their similarity to the majestic fjords of Norway struck a chord with Emily, who had been longing to visit these countries. She then recalled her trip to Portugal and Spain, where she was captivated by the intricate architectural designs and the warm hospitality of the people. The cultural similarities between Portugal and Spain, deeply entrenched in their shared history and common language, had left a lasting impression on her. Their shared love for music, dance, and festivals was evident in their vibrant local life, much like the shared heritage between Iran and Iraq. It was during her travels in the Middle East where she had discovered a rich tapestry of shared history and traditions between Iran and Iraq, leaving her with an enriched understanding of these ancient lands.

Attempt 43: 

1. Read the paragraph carefully and understand the context. The first sentence of the paragraph mentions that the historian is studying the bonds between pairs of countries and their shared histories. Therefore, we need to focus on identifying the pairs of countries mentioned in the paragraph.
2. Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each pair of countries. Start by initialising an empty dictionary.
3. Iterate through the paragraph and extract the pairs of countries mentioned. Use a regular expression like `((\b[A-Za-z]+\b),?\s+(\b[A-Za-z]+\b))` to extract the pairs of countries.
4. For each pair of countries, check if it exists in the dictionary. If it does, increment its frequency. If it doesn't, add it to the dictionary with a frequency of 1.
5. After iterating through the entire paragraph, the dictionary will contain the frequency of each pair of countries. Return the dictionary.

The dynamic relationship between Egypt and Israel, he noted, was filled with faith, conflict, and a shared ethos of survival amidst desert landscapes. From the warm desert sands of Egypt, Fredrick then ventured to the chilly landscapes of Canada where he explored its historic ties with the United States. He learnt about the deep-rooted kinship and friendly neighbourly associations between Canada and the United States, as well as their conflicts, negotiations and shared ambitions. Intrigued, he then voyaged to South America, where he delved into the shared histories of Colombia and Venezuela. Colombia and Venezuela, he found, had a rich history of shared culture, colonial struggles, political debates, and interwoven economies. Fredrick then travelled to Asia, where he studied the complex historical ties between China and Japan. He unveiled tales of ancient trade, invasions, cultural exchanges and diplomatic negotiations that marked the relationship between China and Japan. His expedition concluded in South Africa, where he delved into the liberating tale of South Africa's journey towards freedom - a story echoed by its neighbour, Zimbabwe. Just like South Africa, Zimbabwe had also battled against colonial rule to embrace freedom. Sitting in a cafe in Cape Town, he marvelled at the world's intricate tapestry of interconnected histories, from Sweden to South Africa, reflecting on how distance and borders mattered so little in the shared narratives of the human spirit.'.

This led her to believe that during prehistoric times, there might have been a direct route from Mexico to Peru, allowing a fascinating exchange of ideas, cultures, and traditions. Thrilled by the discovery, she shared the information with her friend Leo, an anthropologist from the United States who had recently been studying cultural connections between the United States and Canada. Leo was intrigued as he had discovered similar links between the United States and Canada, suggesting that there might have been prehistoric connections between these seemingly distant regions. Leo then shared his recent study about the intriguing relationship between South Africa and Kenya. The two African nations, South Africa and Kenya, had a rich tapestry of legends suggesting a shared ancestry and rich cultural exchanges. Marta was reminded of a book she read about the historical ties between Russia and Ukraine. This book discussed extensive trade routes and cultural exchanges between Russia and Ukraine, adding another layer to their complicated history. Similarly, her team had recently found artifacts in Australia, which surprisingly pointed towards a connection with New Zealand. It seemed that Australia and New Zealand, despite being known for their unique isolated biodiversity, also shared a deep historical bond. Leo, smiling, told Marta that his recent visit to Italy had been enlightening as he learned of the ancient interactions between Italy and its neighbor, Greece. He explained that Italy and Greece, despite their renowned and distinct ancient cultures, had influential exchanges in art, language, and governance. Finally, they chatted about their shared trip to South Korea and North Korea where they had learned about the deep ties between the two nations.

Attempt 54: 

1. **Read the text carefully.** Make sure you understand the meaning of the text and identify all the different countries mentioned.
2. **Create a data structure to store the country names and their frequencies.** A dictionary is a good data structure for this task, with the country names as keys and their frequencies as values.
3. **Iterate over the text and count the occurrences of each country.** For each country, check if it already exists in the dictionary. If it does, increment its frequency. If it doesn't, add it to the dictionary with a frequency of 1.
4. **Return the dictionary.** The dictionary will contain the country names as keys and their frequencies as values.

Here is an example implementation of the steps above in Python:

paragraph = "During his adventures in Brazil, Jack discovered an ancient map detailing trade routes between Brazil and Argentina. The map indicated that spices, precious metals, and unique textiles were frequently traded between Brazil and Argentina, highlighting their historical connection. Intrigued, he shared his discovery with his historian buddy, Mike, who lives in Canada. Mike reminded him of the notable similarities between such trade accounts and the historical exchanges between the United Kingdom and Ireland, both of which had profound cultural and economic influences on each other. They also recalled a famous book detailing the fascinating expeditions linking South Africa with Australia. The book portrayed their marine adventures, unraveling the rich biodiversity found in both South Africa and Australia's marine ecosystems. Their discussion shifted to the lively bazaars of Pakistan, remembered by Jack from his past travels. He elaborated on the apparent cultural crossovers between Pakistan and Iran, evident from their cuisine, music, and architectural styles. Mike, moved by this story, reminisced on his trip to Sweden. He narrated his experiences about the historic and cultural ties between Sweden and its neighboring country, Norway, deeply rooted in their shared Viking heritage. The conversation then drifted towards the East, to the land of the rising sun, Japan. They discussed the influence Japan had on South Korea and vice versa, especially in areas such as technology and pop culture. Fascinated with these tales of global connections, they reflected upon how countries, from Brazil to Japan, have shared rich histories, thus knitting a beautiful tapestry of human legacy."

There were also multiple stories of the shared history between the United States and Canada. He described how the border between the United States and Canada was more than just a political boundary, but a symbol of a robust relationship formed over many years. Intriguingly, he also wrote about his travels to Argentina and Brazil, noting the rich shared culture and rivalry between Argentina and Brazil. His reflections on Argentina were filled with admiration for its landscapes and the warmth of its people, while Brazil filled him with wonder with its rich history and natural beauty. Cora, moved by the stories, shared the journal with her friend Bill who had just returned from Italy. Bill was fascinated and narrated his own experiences from Italy, particularly enchanting were his tales about the ancient links between Italy and Greece. He spoke vividly of how the art, architecture, and philosophy of Greece were deeply engrained in the culture of Italy. Bill, intrigued by her great-grandfather's travels, decided to embark on his own adventure, taking with him the insights from the journal and his own experiences from Italy to Greece, naively hoping to write a sequel to her great-grandfather's journal. They both were left in awe, at how interconnected the world was, despite the distances, borders, and years that separated these nations.'.

It illustrated the extensive ties between Argentina and Peru, showcasing an intertwining history of trade and influence that lasted several centuries. The document also suggested intriguing overlaps with similar trade routes between Brazil and Colombia. Traders from Brazil had reportedly journeyed to Colombia in pursuit of valuable resources, creating a significant impact on both Brazil and Colombia's cultural and economic landscapes. Enthralled by her findings, Maria shared them with her friend Jack, a professor from Canada. Jack was deeply engrossed in researching the ancient connections between Canada and the United States. He explained that the indigenous tribes from Canada would often travel to the United States for ceremonies and trade, leading to profound interconnections between Canada and the United States. Jack also mentioned his fascination with the historical ties between Australia and New Zealand. Australia and New Zealand, he explained, had been closely linked due to their geographical proximity and shared roots among the indigenous peoples. Maria, intrigued by Jack's findings, recalled her own research into the ancient connections between Egypt and Israel. She elaborated on the complex and layered history between Egypt and Israel, marked by centuries of warfare, trade, and cultural exchanges.

**Step 3: Iterate over each word in the paragraph**

```python
for word in words:
    # Check if the word is a country name
    if word in ["Canada", "Kenya", 
                "Australia", "South Korea", 
                "Japan", 
                "United States"]:

            country_frequencies[word] += 1
        else:
            country_frequencies[word] = 1
```

**Step 4: Return the dictionary with the country frequencies**

```python
return country_frequencies

**Double-check:**

1. Check if the dictionary is initialized as an empty dictionary.
2. Check if the paragraph is split into words correctly.
3. Check if the loop iterates over each word in the paragraph.
4. Check if the word is a country name.
5. Check if the frequency count is incremented correctly.

Attempt 66: 

**STEP 1: Identify natural split points in the paragraph.**
There are natural breaks in the paragraph based on the countries mentioned. These are:
- Mexico and Italy.
- Iran and Egypt.
- South Korea and Ireland.

**STEP 2: Divide the paragraph into 4 parts.**
Based on the identified split points, the paragraph can be divided into 4 parts:
- **Part 1**: "On a crisp autumn day, Jack, an esteemed professor from the United States, began sharing with his class tales of hidden architectural wonders of **Mexico**. **Mexico**, he explained, was home to ancient civilizations whose remnants were still visible in the form of grand pyramids and intricate carvings. After **Mexico**, he turned the discussion towards **Italy**, and the architectural marvels that stand in testament to their centuries-old history."
- **Part 2**: "The Roman coliseum and the tower of Pisa were favorite examples when discussing **Italy**, he said, as they represent different periods and styles prevalent in **Italy**. He also touched upon **Iran**, describing how the country's rich history is evident in its architecture, from the elaborate mosques to the ancient city of Persepolis. **Iran**, he said, was a treasure trove for historians and architects alike, offering insights into the glorious past of Persia."
- **Part 3**: "As the lecture advanced, he started talking about **Egypt** and its awe-inspiring pyramids. **Egypt**, he said, was a living museum with countless artifacts and structures that had survived thousands of years. Stepping outside architecture, Jack described a trip to **South Korea**, where he had explored the technological advancements of the country."
- **Part 4**: "He explained how **South Korea** was on the cutting edge of technology, with high-speed internet and tech giants that were globally recognized. **South Korea**, he held, was a testament to how technology could drive development. Towards the end, **Ireland** was brought up, as he detailed how the country's landscapes and traditions were equally captivating. **Ireland**, he stated, was an enchanting blend of history and natural beauty, with its numerous castles and lush green landscapes."

**STEP 3: Check for completeness and accuracy.**
Each part should clearly include unique countries and together, they should recreate the original paragraph. If there are any errors or omissions, re-check the steps and identify the source of the error.

Attempt 69: 

**Step 1**: Read the text and identify all the countries mentioned.
**Input**: "One sunny afternoon, Emily and Robert, an adventurous couple from Spain, decided to visit the beautiful landscapes of Ireland after hearing stories about its mesmerizing beauty. Their friend, who had traveled throughout Ireland, had shared tales of emerald valleys, ancient castles, and warm-hearted locals, compelling them to see it for themselves. Having experienced the charming sites of Ireland, they set their sights on Argentina, inspired by the journey of their close friend Jack, who had raved about his experiences in Argentina and Brazil. He described Argentina as a place of magnificent mountains and vast pampas, while Brazil offered magical rainforests and vibrant city life, creating an irresistible wanderlust in Emily and Robert. After exploring the stunning sights of Argentina and Brazil, they got an unexpected call from their friend in Australia. She told them about a festival in Australia that celebrated the cultural ties between Australia and New Zealand, where the exchange of arts, music, and cuisines took center stage. Intrigued, Emily and Robert decided to witness this amalgamation of cultures, which further solidified their respect for Australia and New Zealand's bond. They later received word from another friend residing in Belgium who spoke of an exciting event commemorating the historical ties between Belgium and the Netherlands. Intriguingly, both Belgium and the Netherlands had histories steeped in similar traditions of craftsmanship, resulting in shared architectural and artistic styles. Finally, Emily and Robert decided to conclude their journey in South Korea, where a friendly local spoke about the influence of China in their country. He explained that South Korea and China had a dynamic relationship, a product of centuries of trade, and sometimes conflict, that shaped their current culture and way of life. Thus, this epic journey took them from Spain to South Korea, with experiences that deepened their understanding of the world's shared histories."

The book elaborated how despite their disagreements, Portugal and Spain had a shared heritage that was hard to ignore. Her friend Ben, who had lived in both Spain and Portugal, often spoke about the shared traditions and culture that overpowered their differences. Their discussion then shifted to the exotic travel stories of Ben who had recently returned from a trip to China. He spoke about the beautiful landscapes, bustling cities, and enchanting history of China, and how it beautifully contrasted with its neighboring country, Vietnam. The elegance of China and the charm of Vietnam had left a profound impact on him. He also mentioned how Vietnam and China, despite their past conflicts, shared a deep cultural bond. Ben's travel stories reminded Alice of her friend Claire who had recently moved to Canada. Claire had spoken at length about the differences between Canada and the United States; how the two countries, while very close geographically and often compared to one another, had very distinct identities. She shared stories about her experiences in both Canada and the United States, highlighting the unique cultural facets of each nation. Intrigued by such narratives, Alice too expressed her desire to explore these countries. After a day filled with tales from Spain to the United States, they walked out of the coffee shop with a newfound appreciation for the world's diverse cultures and histories."

1. **Initialize an empty dictionary called `country_frequency`**: This dictionary will store the frequency of each country's appearance in the paragraph.

```python
country_frequency = {}
```

2. **Iterate over the input dictionaries:** The input dictionaries are the results of previous tasks, where each key is a country and each value is its frequency.

```python
for country_dict in [previous_task_result_1, previous_task_result_2, previous_task_result_3, previous_task_result_4]:
```

3. **Iterate over each country in the current input dictionary:**

```python
    for country, frequency in country_dict.items():
```

4. **Check if the `country` is already a key in `country_frequency`:** If it is, add `frequency` to the existing value. Otherwise, initialize the value to `frequency`.

```python
        if country in country_frequency:
            country_frequency[country] += frequency
        else:
            country_frequency[country] = frequency
```

5. **Repeat steps 2-4 for all input dictionaries:**

```python
country_frequency = {}
for country_dict in [previous_task_result_1, previous_task_result_2, previous_task_result_3, previous_task_result_4]:
    for country, frequency in country_dict.items():
        if country in country_frequency:
            country_frequency[country] += frequency
        else:
            country_frequency[country] = frequency
```

6. **Return `country_frequency` as the final result:** This dictionary will contain the frequency of each country's appearance in the paragraph.

```python
return country_frequency
```

**Double-check for errors:**

* **Ensure that `country_frequency` is initialized as an empty dictionary before the loop.**
* **Check that the keys in `country_dict` are countries and the values are frequencies.**
* **Verify that the `if` and `else` statements correctly handle existing and new countries, respectively.**
Only output final result without any additional text or thought! Answer in JSON format

The tales of how the Pharaohs\' knowledge shaped the philosophies of Greece had amazed him ever since his childhood. His fascination wasn\'t limited to Egypt and Greece though; he was equally captivated by the historical exchanges between the Persian empires of Iran and the Indus valley civilization in Pakistan. These two countries, Iran and Pakistan, despite being so geographically apart, had a rich and intertwining history. One day, while reading a book on world history, he stumbled upon the cultural and political exchanges between the prosperous kingdoms of India and China in ancient times. The way India and China, two colossal civilizations, had intermingled their philosophies fascinated him. As he delved deeper, he discovered the lesser-known naval expeditions from the royal fleets of China visiting the archipelago of Indonesia, trading silk for spices. These maritime interactions between China and Indonesia reflected the strategic significance of the latter. His interest deepened when he read about the exploration expeditions between the United Kingdom and Australia, with the latter once seen as the "Land of Golden Opportunities" by the UK. Intriguingly, the connection wasn\'t just limited trading but was rather a complex relationship between the United Kingdom and Australia involving colonization, settlement, and later, independence. This led him to learn about the profound relationships between neighboring nations like Portugal and Spain, with their shared culture, history, and rivalry. The more John read about Portugal and Spain, the more he found himself engrossed in their fascinating intertwining histories. He was equally intrigued about the historical bonds between Belgium and the Netherlands, two countries that despite being distinct, shared a common past that was still evident in their culture. These complex ties between Belgium and the Netherlands made him even more passionate about world history. His extensive readings affirmed that the world was wonderfully intricate and deeply interconnected, right from Egypt to the Netherlands.\'.

1. **Read the paragraph carefully** to get a general idea of its content and to identify the different countries mentioned.

2. **Divide the paragraph into four equal subparagraphs.** Each subparagraph should contain about the same number of words.

3. **Check your work** to make sure that each subparagraph is about the same length and that it covers a distinct part of the paragraph.

**The four subparagraphs are:**

1. **Subparagraph 1:** John, an avid traveler from Canada, had recently returned from an exciting trip to Japan, a country he had always wanted to visit. He was mesmerized by Japan's rich history and unique culture and was intrigued by the stories he heard about the ancient samurai warriors of Japan. In his conversations with locals, he heard tales of the historic trade relations between Japan and China, and how both Japan and China had influenced each other's art, culture, and technological progress. Captivated by these historical narratives, John decided to take his next adventure to China.

2. **Subparagraph 2:** Upon reaching China, he was fascinated by the Great Wall, which served as a symbol of China's strength and resilience. The locals in China also shared stories about the Silk Road and how it connected China with Iran, leading to the exchange of goods, ideas, and culture. Intrigued by this, John penciled in Iran as his next destination.

3. **Subparagraph 3:** Upon his arrival in Iran, John was amazed by the grandeur of the Persepolis and the many tales of Iran's ancient civilizations. In Iran, he learned of the country's deep-rooted connections with Iraq, from the shared religious beliefs to the common history of the Persian Gulf. Curiosity piqued, John subsequently decided to visit Iraq. In Iraq, he witnessed the remnants of Babylon, illustrating Iraq's significance in world history.

4. **Subparagraph 4:** Iraq's historical narrative also emphasized its ties with Turkey, a country known for its rich history and diverse culture. John then mapped out his route to Turkey, eager to explore another chapter in the grand tale of interconnected nations. In Turkey, the grandeur of the Hagia Sophia awestruck him, sparking conversations about Turkey's unique position at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. Stories of Turkey's past reminded him of Greece's history, particularly Turkey and Greece's shared heritage and sometimes tumultuous coexistence. This made John eager to continue his historical exploration in Greece. The links that had drawn him from Canada to Japan, from there to China and Iran, and eventually to Iraq, Turkey, and Greece, reminded him of the intricate web of connections that made up human history.

In his conversations with locals, he heard tales of the historic trade relations between Japan and China, and how both Japan and China had influenced each other's art, culture, and technological progress. Captivated by these historical narratives, John decided to take his next adventure to China. Upon reaching China, he was fascinated by the Great Wall, which served as a symbol of China's strength and resilience. The locals in China also shared stories about the Silk Road and how it connected China with Iran, leading to the exchange of goods, ideas, and culture. Intrigued by this, John penciled in Iran as his next destination. Upon his arrival in Iran, John was amazed by the grandeur of the Persepolis and the many tales of Iran's ancient civilizations. In Iran, he learned of the country's deep-rooted connections with Iraq, from the shared religious beliefs to the common history of the Persian Gulf. Curiosity piqued, John subsequently decided to visit Iraq. In Iraq, he witnessed the remnants of Babylon, illustrating Iraq's significance in world history. Iraq's historical narrative also emphasized its ties with Turkey, a country known for its rich history and diverse culture. John then mapped out his route to Turkey, eager to explore another chapter in the grand tale of interconnected nations. In Turkey, the grandeur of the Hagia Sophia awestruck him, sparking conversations about Turkey's unique position at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. Stories of Turkey's past reminded him of Greece's history, particularly Turkey and Greece's shared heritage and sometimes tumultuous coexistence. This made John eager to continue his historical exploration in Greece. The links that had drawn him from Canada to Japan, from there to China and Iran, and eventually to Iraq, Turkey, and Greece, reminded him of the intricate web of connections that made up human history.'.

Jenny, a travel enthusiast from the United States, had a particularly fascinating story to tell about her time in Russia. She insisted that the more she traveled around Russia, the more it felt like she was navigating through a book of diverse and complex tales. She further mentioned that the art, culture, and history of Russia left a profound impact on her, making her visit all too memorable. Recently, she met Kazuo, a friend from Japan, who had a completely unique experience in Iran. He claimed Iran to be a nation of warm hospitality and stunning heritage, contrasting drastically with the public perception of Iran. Kazuo explained how Iran, despite controversies, held immense beauty and complex history that would surprise many. He also had a chance to explore Pakistan, and he found it equally diverse and intriguing. Each city in Pakistan, he noted, told a different story and held fascinating secrets that often went unnoticed in the world's eyes. Meanwhile, Jenny also had a fantastic experience during her visit to Australia. The wildlife, the landscapes, and the laid-back lifestyle of Australia were both thrilling and relaxing at the same time. She stated how Australia's natural beauty and its unique flora and fauna were truly captivating. Speaking of natural beauty, Jenny and Kazuo were both eager to visit Canada. Stories of the breathtaking landscapes, wildlife, and multicultural cities of Canada had always intrigued them. Canada, they believed, symbolized a perfect blend of urban life harmoniously co-existing with nature. After exchanging tales of travel and their shared yearning for Canada,

they concluded that exploring different nations like Russia, Iran, Australia, and Pakistan opens doors to learning about diverse cultures, histories, and lifestyles. It was the shared understanding of the immense beauty each country held, and the desire to see more of the world that strengthened their bond.

She loved reading about how scholars from Greece and Egypt exchanged ideas, contributing to the foundation of philosophical and mathematical thoughts. Alice, who was from the United States, had a longtime friend, Ying, from China. Ying, who studied ancient arts, was particularly interested in the historical links between China and Japan. She explained that the cultural exchanges between China and Japan had fostered a significant development in arts, religions, philosophy, and social organizations. It was evident that Alice and Ying shared a profound interest in the historical connections between countries. Alice, fondly reminiscing about her trip to Australia, mentioned its curious connection with New Zealand. She mentioned how Australia and New Zealand shared a similar culture and history, with both being colonies of the United Kingdom. Ying, reminded of her visit to South Korea, shared how she learned about the deep cultural and historical connections between North Korea and South Korea. Despite the current political divide, there was undeniable shared heritage and history between North Korea and South Korea. Both excitedly shared stories about their visit to Europe, Alice had been to Ireland and Ying had visited Poland. Alice brightened up talking about the shared culture of Ireland and the United Kingdom, while Ying shared her fascination with the rich history and cultural ties between Poland and Ukraine. As they connected these dots, they found themselves growing more passionate about history and decided to plan a trip to explore more connections around the world."

1. Read the paragraph carefully and identify all the countries mentioned.
2. Create a dictionary with the countries as keys and initialize the values to 0.
3. Iterate through the paragraph and check if the current word matches any of the keys in the dictionary.
4. If a match is found, increment the corresponding value by 1.
5. Otherwise, continue to the next word.
6. Once you have iterated through the entire paragraph, the dictionary will contain the frequency of each country's appearance.

paragraph = "On a historical expedition in Vietnam, professor Albert uncovered evidence of an ancient civilization that had moved from China. The artifacts had intricate designs and symbols that were distinctly from China's long-lost dynasties, suggesting an unknown migration. Elated from his discovery, Albert decided to share the news with his colleague, professor Catherine, an archaeology expert residing in Canada. She expressed excitement and revealed an interesting fact about the indigenous tribes within Canada and their ancestral connections to the United States. Many tribes in Canada, she revealed, had migrated from the United States, carrying with them rich cultural traditions and histories that continue to thrive today. Catherine had also collaborated with an archaeologist from Australia, who had discovered ties between the indigenous cultures of Australia and New Zealand. Both Australia and New Zealand housed tribes that shared certain hunting techniques, artistic styles, and even linguistic patterns, pointing towards a common ancestor. Albert recalled his recent trip to the exotic landscapes of Peru, where he had learned about its historical connections with Argentina. Peru and Argentina, he learned, had strong historical links due to shared Inca traditions and the movement of people between the two territories in ancient times. Speaking of South America, Catherine shared her intriguing research on the pre-colonial connections between Mexico and Cuba. She explained that Mexico and Cuba had ancient ties, probably linked through trade and the Caribbean sea currents. Albert then reminisced about his experiences in Greece where he had discovered links between Greece and Italy. Both Greece and Italy, it seemed, were part of an ancient network of intellectual and commercial exchanges that shaped the western civilization. As the conversation ended, they realized how interwoven the world truly was - from Vietnam to Italy, human history had created countless connections across continents."

**Quarter 1:** Travelling through Norway, Anna came across ancient tales of Viking expeditions to Ireland. The stories described how the fierce Vikings from Norway had established settlements in many parts of Ireland, transforming its landscape and culture. After her trip to Norway, she journeyed to Ireland, hoping to unearth more about the Viking history hidden in its verdant valleys.

**Quarter 2:** In Ireland, the Vikings' influence was still palpable through the myriad of artifacts displayed in the local museums and the intriguing tales spun by the locals. While in Ireland, she met a researcher from Australia who was studying the movements of the Vikings. He shared some fascinating insights about the Vikings' travels to the United Kingdom, and how they had left a profound impact there too, raiding and settling in what are now England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. This sparked Anna's curiosity about Australia, prompting her next career move to the continent down under.

**Quarter 3:** Once in Australia, she discovered an entirely different narrative of indigenous cultures and European colonization. Interestingly, she found parallels to the history of colonisation in New Zealand. Discussions with locals and historians led her to understand that Australia and New Zealand share a complex cultural and political history, their paths shaped by European interventions. Recalling her earlier passion for the Viking history, she decided to travel to Sweden, another country with a rich Viking past.

**Quarter 4:** The country's history reminded her of the tales she had heard in Norway, especially the exploits of the Vikings in Sweden and their adventures across the North Sea. In Sweden, she delved deeper into the history of Viking travels to Russia, a country that had been significantly impacted by the Vikings. She found the connections between Sweden and Russia fascinating, the imprint of Viking trade routes still visible through the historical sites scattered across Russia. Her journey through Norway, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden and Russia had been a fascinating exploration of historical links and cultural exchanges, leaving her with a deeper understanding and appreciation of the interconnected world.

**Step 3: Identify the countries mentioned in each quarter.**

**Quarter 1:** Norway, Ireland

**Quarter 2:** Ireland, Australia, United Kingdom, England, Scotland, Northern Ireland

**Quarter 3:** Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, Norway

**Quarter 4:** Sweden, Russia, Norway

In Ireland, the Vikings' influence was still palpable through the myriad of artifacts displayed in the local museums and the intriguing tales spun by the locals.

He shared some fascinating insights about the Vikings' travels to the United Kingdom, and how they had left a profound impact there too, raiding and settling in what are now England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. This sparked Anna's curiosity about Australia, prompting her next career move to the continent down under.

Attempt 88: 

**Step 1**: Read the paragraph and identify all the countries mentioned.

**Input**: "Sarah, an avid traveler from the **United States**, had spent a considerable amount of time in **France** and was fascinated by its history and culture. Her experiences in France had given her a deeper understanding of the world, inspiring her to visit more countries to learn about their histories. She shared her experiences with her friend John from **Australia**, who was interested in the wildlife and ecology of different regions. He mentioned his travels to **Kenya** and how the local tribes in Kenya had a culture vastly different from Australia. His stories about Kenya intrigued Sarah, piquing her interest in the African continent. Sarah, in turn, told John about her visit to **Colombia**, where she dived deep into the country's history of emeralds and other precious gems. During her time in Colombia, she had visited the emerald mines and learned how the mining industry had shaped the country's economy. It was the richness of Colombia's history that led her to her next destination, **Peru**, known for its Incan heritage. She shared tales about Peru, filled with myths, mysteries, and ancient civilizations that fascinated John. Intrigued by Sarah's tales, John spoke about his visit to north, to **Russia**. He found Russia vastly different from Australia, with its vast landscapes and rich history that dated back many centuries. His fascination for Russia led him to explore more about its neighboring country, **Ukraine**. He found the shared history of Russia and Ukraine intriguing, with its many cultural, political, and historical overlaps. This led them both to ponder about how interconnected the world is, from the United States to Ukraine, each country with its unique story to tell. They ended the evening with a promise to explore the world more and find the hidden stories within the landscapes of these incredible countries."

**Countries mentioned**: United States, France, Australia, Kenya, Colombia, Peru, Russia, Ukraine

1. Split the paragraph into four quarters.
   - Quarter 1: "John, a travel blogger from Australia, had been mesmerized by the vibrant culture and history of Mexico, where he was currently exploring. He had taken a particular interest in the ancient Mayan civilization, which once flourished in Mexico and whose influence could still be seen in the country's architecture and traditions."
   - Quarter 2: "While in Mexico, he had also discovered a shared history with Peru, where Mayan traders were believed to have ventured for trade. By studying the artifacts and tales in Peru, John was able to see a reflection of Mexico's bygone era. His adventures in Mexico and Peru fueled his interest in indigenous cultures, leading him to plan a trip to Canada."
   - Quarter 3: "His journey to Canada introduced him to the rich and colourful traditions of the First Nations. In Canada, he found echoes of Australia's own native tribes, reinforcing his belief in the interconnectedness of cultures. His exploration in Canada led him to learn about the country's historical ties with the United Kingdom."
   - Quarter 4: "Having spent a year in the United Kingdom earlier, he couldn't help but see the shared patterns of history, architecture, and societal structures between Canada and the United Kingdom. The following year, he decided to explore Asia, starting with South Korea. He was taken by the technological advancements in South Korea, a stark contrast to the traditional cultures he had been studying. South Korea fascinated him with its unique blend of tradition and modernity, reminding him of his own hometown in Australia. The urban fabric of South Korea, he thought, was reminiscent of the United Kingdom's bustling cities. His travels didn't stop there, as he ventured to India, drawn by its rich history and diversity. He found that, much like Australia, India was a melting pot of cultures, languages, and traditions, just with a different flavor. He realized that no matter where he went, be it Mexico or South Korea, India or Canada, each country had its unique charm and a story to tell."

2. Count the countries in each quarter.
   - Quarter 1: Mexico, Peru
   - Quarter 2: Mexico, Peru, Canada

The artifact insinuated that ages ago, traders from Sweden might have voyaged to Norway, bringing with them unique cultural elements. As he dug deeper, Peter discovered more artifacts resembling those found in Poland, showing evidence of a historical connection between Norway and Poland. It seemed that at one point in history, Norway might have had significant interaction with Poland, possibly through trade or migration.

During this conversation, Peter recalled his time in Argentina, where he came across narratives of exchanges between Argentina and Brazil. Intriguingly, Argentina and Brazil, despite their differences, had a shared heritage rooted in indigenous cultures and European colonization. Thinking of his time in Brazil, Peter remembered how stories of sugar-exporting routes to Portugal were common. Brazil and Portugal, bound by colonial history, had a complex relationship that shaped their identities. The professor, listening intently, shared that he had spent time in India, where he had learned about the nation's historical links with Pakistan. The shared history between India and Pakistan, he explained, was an intricate narrative of culture, conflict, and camaraderie, just like those of Norway with Sweden and Poland, Argentina with Brazil, or Canada with the United States. As they ended their conversation, they both reflected on the complex web of connections that linked countries across continents.'.

Attempt 97: 

**Step 1: Divide the paragraph into four equal subparagraphs.**

To do this, you can use the following method:

1. Count the total number of sentences in the paragraph.
2. Divide the total number of sentences by 4.
3. Round up the result to the nearest whole number.

In this case, there are 16 sentences in the paragraph. Dividing 16 by 4 gives us 4. Rounding up to the nearest whole number gives us 5.

Therefore, we need to divide the paragraph into five equal subparagraphs.

**Step 2: Create the subparagraphs.**

To do this, you can use the following method:

1. Start at the beginning of the paragraph.
2. Count the number of sentences in each subparagraph.
3. When you reach the end of a subparagraph, start a new line.

Using this method, we can create the following subparagraphs:

**Subparagraph 1:**

James, an avid traveler from the United States, found himself in Argentina, fascinated by the rich history and vibrant culture. His curiosity about Argentina's past was sparked by stories about the Indigenous people who had been there long before European settlers arrived. Interestingly, he learned that Argentina had a profound cultural exchange with Brazil, due to their geographical proximity.

**Subparagraph 2:**

Inspired by the intertwining histories of Argentina and Brazil, James planned his next journey to Italy. While in Italy, stories of how Italy had been profoundly influenced by Greece fascinated him. From Italy's architecture to philosophy, the impact of Greece was truly remarkable.

**Subparagraph 3:**

After Italy, James was drawn to the unique cultures and histories of Asia. He decided to visit China, where he learned about China's one-time most influential ally, North Korea. Despite the significant changes in their relationship over the years, China and North Korea share a dynamic and complex history that defies simple categorization.

**Subparagraph 4:**

Then, the stories of North Korea's estrangement from South Korea intrigued him. Intrigued by Korea's split, he traveled to South Korea to understand the other side of the story. South Korea, he discovered, had a completely different narrative to share about their relationship with North Korea. As he ended his trip in South Korea, he realized how compelling the stories of different nations are, from Argentina to South Korea, and how their histories are interconnected.

**Step 3: Double check your work.**

To double check your work, you can use the following method:

1. Count the number of sentences in each subparagraph.
2. Make sure that the number of sentences in each subparagraph is the same.
3. Check to make sure that the subparagraphs are in the correct order.

In this case, each subparagraph has 4 sentences. The subparagraphs are in the correct order. Therefore, your work is correct.
['1) Argentina, Brazil, Italy, and Greece\n2) China, North Korea, and South Korea\n3) Argentina, and Brazil\n4) Italy, and Greece']

During his studies, he found that Australia had been a crossroads of cultures, with influences flowing from the far clubs of Indonesia, enriching the local societies. Indonesia, with its diverse culture and rich history, had a lot more to offer than it had received. Similarly, according to an ancient text John discovered, there was evidence of strong connections between the cultures of Egypt and Iran. The text suggested that Egypt and Iran might have influenced each other's architectural styles, owing to the trades and nomadic migrations between the two. Intrigued by this interplay of influences, John decided to delve deeper, leading him to the complex relationship between Brazil and Argentina. The historical records revealed that Brazil and Argentina, despite their differences, were tied together by a shared history of colonial conquest, rebellion, and periods of peace. To his surprise, he stumbled upon a document about a significant trade agreement between Poland and Sweden in the 15th century. It appeared that Poland and Sweden, despite political tensions, had formed alliances for mutual benefits, resulting in interesting overlaps in their folklores. As he researched further, John discovered that the United Kingdom and Ireland had a similarly complicated yet intriguing shared history. The United Kingdom and Ireland, despite their tumultuous past, have witnessed cultural exchanges and shared literary traditions. Lastly, a short anecdote about the close-knit relationship between South Korea and Japan caught his interest. The story revealed how South Korea and Japan, two nations with a complicated history, have influenced each other's cuisine, art, and music. Reflecting on his research, John marveled at the intricate web of relationships that exists between countries such as Australia and Japan, revealing the fascinating tapestry of human history and cultural evolution.'.
