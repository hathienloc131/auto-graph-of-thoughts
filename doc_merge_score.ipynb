While there is some repetition of information from the original NDAs, the merged document streamlines and combines these sections, reducing redundancy.\\n- Retained Information Score of 7: The merged NDA <S> retains key elements from the original NDAs, such as the definition of confidential information, obligations of the receiving party, exclusions, non-competition clauses, and general provisions. It emphasizes the core principles of confidentiality and non-disclosure while incorporating essential details from the original agreements. Nonetheless, some specific details unique to the individual NDAs are not included in the merged document, impacting the retained information score.', '<Redundancy>5</Redundancy>\\n<Retained>8</Retained>\\n\\nReasoning:\\n- Redundancy Score: The summary NDA <S> has significant redundancy because it only includes information from one of the original NDAs (Doc2) and excludes crucial details covered in the other NDAs. This results in a redundancy score of 5.\\n- Retained Information Score: Despite the redundancy, the summary NDA <S> manages to retain most of the important clauses and obligations related to non-disclosure agreements from Doc2. However, it lacks the specifics and nuances covered in the other original NDAs, resulting in a score of 8 for retained information.', '<Redundancy>4</Redundancy>\\n<Retained>6</Retained>\\n\\nReasoning:\\n- The merged NDA <S> mainly retains the content from Document 2, incorporating its structure and key provisions while omitting specific details from Documents 1, 3, and 4.\\n- There is some redundancy in the merged NDA <S> as certain details like the purpose, obligations, exclusions, non-competition, term and termination, and general provisions are rephrased or repeated from Document 2, which reduces the score for redundancy.\\n- The retained information score is higher as the merged NDA effectively preserves the core elements and structure from Document 2, thereby maintaining the essence of the original NDA information while leaving out some details from the other documents.']\n",
